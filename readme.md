## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Power BI solution that automates data extraction from email attachments. The goal is to eliminate manual data handling, allowing business intelligence teams to focus on insights and analysis rather than tedious tasks. The automation reduces labor and cost, and enhances reporting efficiency, especially in a real-world fintech application.

## Data Sources
- **Email Attachments**: Data is sourced from corporate email attachments (limited to corporate email clients, as Gmail and Yahoo are not supported for security reasons).
- **Internal Financial Data**: Extracted monthly reports and sales data from the fintech company’s internal systems.

## Tools
- **Power BI**: To automate data extraction, processing, and visualization.
- **Corporate Email Client**: The project integrates directly with corporate email systems to automate data extraction from attachments.
- **Python/Power Query**: Minimal scripting to enable automation without requiring significant coding expertise.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Automated extraction of over 500 email attachments monthly, including data validation and format standardization.
- Continuous data refresh cycle, ensuring that dashboards are updated without any manual intervention.
- Data cleaning focused on eliminating inconsistencies from manually entered email reports, ensuring high-quality data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Key exploratory steps included:
- Understanding recurring patterns in the extracted sales data.
- Identifying anomalies and gaps in data submission from various teams.

## Data Analysis
This section highlights key aspects of the data analysis process:
- **Email Attachment Automation**: Power BI was used to automatically pull data from email attachments without requiring users to open the emails, saving significant time.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Built visually appealing dashboards that provided real-time insights to stakeholders.
- **Case Study Implementation**: Applied this automation in a fintech case study, showcasing how it reduced manual labor by over 80%, saving 4-5 months per individual annually.
- **Scalability**: Demonstrated how the system can be scaled to other departments, allowing multiple teams to benefit from automated reporting without added personnel.

## Results/Findings
- **Efficiency Gains**: The automation process saved over 80% of manual labor, translating to 4-5 months per individual annually.
- **Cost Savings**: Expected cost savings of ₹600,000 annually in reduced manpower and enhanced data quality.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Delivered real-time insights to over 10 stakeholders, reducing decision-making time by 30% and improving the accuracy of sales forecasts.
- **Improved Data Quality**: Automation minimized human error in data handling, resulting in cleaner, more reliable data for analysis.

## Recommendations
- **Expand Automation**: This process can be extended to other departments to further reduce manual labor and enhance reporting.
- **Increase Real-Time Capabilities**: Integrating real-time data from external APIs could enhance decision-making further by providing up-to-the-minute insights.
- **User Training**: Providing training on Power BI automation features to employees could help scale the solution across teams.

## Limitations
- **Corporate Email Dependency**: The system is currently limited to corporate email clients, and would require adjustments to function with other email providers.
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: While minimal coding is required, some initial setup for integration with email clients can be complex for non-technical users.
